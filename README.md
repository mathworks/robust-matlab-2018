# Developing Robust MATLAB Code
Paul Peeling, Mathworks

As the size and complexity of your MATLAB® application increases, you want make sure to structure software projects well, ensuring users can run code without encountering unexpected behaviour or errors, for example. In this talk, you will learn about relevant advanced MATLAB software development capabilities, including error handling, object-oriented programming (OOP), unit testing, version control, and change tracking.

This repository provides the code and examples used in the session.
